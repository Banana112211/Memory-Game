# Memory Game Project
This was the second project for the Front-End nanodegree from udacity ( https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd001).  The goal was to build your own voersion of the classic memory game "Concentration", using plain JavaScript, DOM selectors and Event Listeners.
Focus of the project was to exercise DOM manipulation.

## How to Play
1. Clone or download the project
2. Open the index.html file in a browser 

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

### Each turn:

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

### Rating

* ⭐️⭐️⭐️ If the moves are between 8 and 11.
* ⭐️⭐️ If the moves are between 12 and 19.
* ⭐️ If the moves are 20 or more.
