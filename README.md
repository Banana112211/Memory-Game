# Memory Game Project
This was the second project for the Front-End nanodegree from udacity ( https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd001).
Focus of the project was to exercise DOM manipulation.
## Used technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JS

## How to Play
Click the card to find a match. The goal is to match all 16 cards as fast as possible.
The stars rating depends on the number of moves:

⭐️⭐️⭐️ If the moves are between 8 and 11.
⭐️⭐️ If the moves are between 12 and 19.
⭐️ If the moves are 20 or more.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched. The player could restart the game at any time by clicking on the restart icon.


Please feel free to copy or clone the project.
